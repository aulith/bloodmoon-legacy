#  House Varkareth

_"Blood is the thread of fate, and we are the ones who weave destiny."_

**Family head** : Lady Carmilla Varkareth  - The Scarlet Seamstress

> Masters of blood weaving, manipulating the blood of others to cause paralysis, agony, or even forced obedience.

> Can temporarily borrow abilities from those whose blood they drink, making them highly adaptive combatants

> Ritualistic and reverent, believing blood is sacred and must be used with purpose.

**Their spawn:** The Varkareth create lesser vampire thralls known as The Unraveled. These spawn's bodies are weak and fragile, their minds half-consumed by hunger. They serve as enforcers, couriers, and expendable warriorsâ€”useful tools but never equals to the true members of the house. 

To _become_ a Varkareth is to go through a process called **The Weaving** , a ritual - _an extra step_ - before they call you one of their own.
