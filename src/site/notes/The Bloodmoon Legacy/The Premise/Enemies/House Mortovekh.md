# House Mortovekh
_"Death is not an end, but an eternal beginning."_

**Family head :** Baron Kain Mortovekh - The Eternal Harbinger

> Necrotic vampires that can raise and command undead, binding them with blood magic.

> Their bodies are more corpse-like, with cold, deathly skin, yet they never rot.

> They see themselves as the true rulers of death, believing undeath is a perfected state of existence.

**Their Spawn:** The Mortovekh.. They turn individuals who have been weighed down by guilt, despair, or those who have a long history with death—whether through personal loss, a desire to conquer mortality, or a twisted thirst for power over life itself... They undergo a process of transformation that binds them to death itself, making them extensions of their maker's will and, more importantly, the will of mortality.

.._Being_ a Mortovekh vampire means accepting and embracing death—not as a fearful end, but as a gateway to a higher form of existence. These vampires are not concerned with immortality for the sake of living forever; instead, they seek **control** over death itself, gaining powers of necromancy, shadow manipulation, and the ability to commune with the spirits of the dead. 

To be a Mortovekh vampire is to be a master of decay, and in their eyes, death is a tool, not something to be avoided. To join House Mortovekh is to become one with death, to walk the line between life and the afterlife, and to use that knowledge and power to bend the world to your _will._
