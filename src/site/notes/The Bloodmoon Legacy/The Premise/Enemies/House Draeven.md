**Family head :**  Lady Corvina Draven - The Beast Unleashed

> Rejects diplomacy, valuing strength and primal dominance above all else.

**Their Spawn:** Draeven creates a special breed of vampire spawn, called Bloodfangs. These creatures are enforcers and hunters, bred and chosen to carry out their mastersâ€™ will. Unlike traditional vampire spawn, Bloodfangs retain more intelligence and self-control but are often driven by a deep hunger for blood and violence.

To _be_ a Draeven vampire is to embrace the very essence of ferocity, dominance, and raw power. It is a transformation not just of the body, but of the soul, casting away the shackles of humanity and stepping into the abyss of primal strength. _Becoming a Draeven_ vampire means surrendering to the beast inside, and in doing so, unlocking a fierce new existence where survival and power are paramount.
