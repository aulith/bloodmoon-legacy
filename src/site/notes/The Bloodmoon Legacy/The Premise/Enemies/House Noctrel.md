# House Noctrel
_"In darkness, we are all equal."_

**Family head** : Lord Ravian Noctrel - The Dark Whisperer

> Masters of shadowmancy, able to merge with darkness, travel through shadows, and become nearly invisible in dim light.

> Their presence unnerves mortals, as they can induce irrational fear with a mere glance.

> Prefers political manipulation and secrecy, pulling strings from the shadows rather than brute force.

**Their Spawn:** Unlike many other houses, House Noctrel does not create traditional vampire thralls or spawn. Instead, they create husks—humans or vampires who have fallen into shadow without fully undergoing the turning process. These individuals are weak, often semi-conscious, and live in the deep corners of Noctrel’s shadowy sanctuaries, serving as servants or enforcers.

To _become_ a Noctrel - It takes a lot - To them vampirism isn't just _a gift_ but a _metamorphosis_ - a transformation into something more than human, something unseen. The Noctrel look for those capable of stealth - hiding. Those who exist in the shadows of society for them _to claim as their own._
