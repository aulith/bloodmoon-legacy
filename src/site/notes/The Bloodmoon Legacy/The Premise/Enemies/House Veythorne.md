# House Veythorne 
_''For every whisper sows the seed of power - We are the manipulators."_

**Family head : ** Lord Darius Veythorne - The Silent Enchanter

> Skilled in charming and hypnotizing both mortals and weaker vampires, able to control minds with their words.

> Their venomous bite doesn’t just turn victims—it causes euphoric hallucinations, making death a blissful experience.

> Often found in courts and high society, using elegance as a weapon just as sharp as their fangs.

**Their Spawn:** Their style of vampirism involves turning individuals who are susceptible to manipulation—those with ambitions, weaknesses, or deep desires that can be twisted to the family’s advantage. Once turned, these individuals are groomed to serve House Veythorne’s agenda. The vampires of House Veythorne are patient, playing the long game and biding their time until they can strike _decisively~_

To _become_ a Veythorne vampire is all about mastering the art of influence. It requires intelligence, strategy, and the ability to manipulate others through charm, deception, and subtlety. The Veythorne seek those who seek to be a shadowy puppeteer, pulling the strings from the darkness, ensuring that their every move is calculated to secure their power. Victory for them is not achieved through force, but through the silent, insidious manipulation of those around them.

_And beware - if a Veythorne finds you special. You shall be followed , hunted.. And manipulated.. They want the **perfect** - most **beautiful** little dolls all to themselves._
