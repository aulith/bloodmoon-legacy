You are the last generation of legendary vampire-hunting families—your ancestors carved their names into history as the slayers of the night. For centuries, your families have fought against the darkness, purging vampires, monsters, and the undead from the world. But now, the greatest test of all has arrived... The Red Eclipse! A cataclysmic celestial event that occurs once every 500 years, is approaching. When the blood moon rises, the Countess of Duskveil and the four vampire noble houses will ascend to untold power, plunging the world into eternal night. You and your fellow hunters have been summoned by the Order of the Silver Stake for one mission: Eliminate Countess Selena Duskveil and the Four Blooded Heirs before the Red Eclipse. But as you hunt the vampires, you will unravel the dark truths of your own families and the world itself? What secrets have been buried beneath centuries of bloodshed? And are you truly the hunters… or are you just another piece in the Countess’s eternal game?
