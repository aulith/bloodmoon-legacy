# Rumour
> ''Some say he should be dead, that he once strayed too far into the darkness and was cut down by his own parents, only to rise again through means unknown. Others whisper that he was never truly human to begin withâ€”that his power comes not from faith or silver, but from something far older, something that watches and waits beyond the veil.''
