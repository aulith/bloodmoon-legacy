The **Vanthrel** family is legendary throughout the world for their unparalleled skill in combat and their unyielding dedication to hunting vampires. Unlike other vampire hunters who rely on divine magic or religious fervor, the Vanthrels believe in the power of **steel**, **fire**, and sheer **physical prowess**. They are the most renowned physical vampire hunters, celebrated not for their magical abilities, but for their grit, their mastery of weapons, and their tireless devotion to eliminating the undead.

The Vanthrels view vampires as a physical challenge to be overcome with skill and precision. Their belief is rooted in the idea that the undead are not merely a threat to the soul but a direct affront to the human form and the strength of will. They see themselves as protectors of life, not through divine light, but through the raw power of combat. To them, it is not faith or magic that will eradicate the vampire plague, but the strength of the human spirit forged in the fire of battle.
