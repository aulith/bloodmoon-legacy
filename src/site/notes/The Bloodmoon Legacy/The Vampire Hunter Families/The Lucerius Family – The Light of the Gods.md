The Lucerius family has long been renowned as one of the most devout and influential bloodlines in the world. Their roots trace back to the early days of the First Crusade, when they first rose to prominence as holy warriors tasked with combating the vampiric scourge that threatened the land. The Lucerius family is composed almost exclusively of clerics, paladins, and devoted warriors, each one bound by a sacred oath to uphold the will of the gods and maintain the sanctity of life.

They believe that vampires are an unholy plague upon the landâ€”creatures of corruption and death who serve no purpose but to spread chaos, suffering, and darkness. They see the undead as an affront to the natural order and a direct challenge to the gods' divine authority. Thus, the Lucerius family has sworn an eternal divine mission: to hunt down and destroy vampires, purging them from the world with radiant power. Their war against the undead is not just a matter of duty but a sacred calling, one that transcends personal desires and worldly concerns.
