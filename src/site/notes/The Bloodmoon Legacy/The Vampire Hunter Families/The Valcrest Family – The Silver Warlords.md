Once a noble house, the Valcrests nearly lost everything to the vampire families long ago. They were the first hunters to wield their own blood as a weapon, using enchanted artifacts to fuel their abilities. Valcrests walk the line between power and madness, wielding cursed weapons that whisper to them in their sleep. Their ancestors' spirits guide them—or haunt them.

They became the **first** to wield their **own blood** as a weapon, using **enchanted artifacts** that infused their very essence into weapons of unimaginable power. These dark tools—born from a mixture of ancient necromancy and blood magic—came at a **terrible cost**. The Valcrests walk a **fine line** between incredible **power** and irreversible **madness**.

While their blood-infused weapons are capable of slaying even the most powerful vampires, these cursed items come with an **unnerving cost**: they whisper to their wielders in the dead of night, urging them to **surrender control** to the darkness within. Each Valcrest warrior is a **slave** to these voices, whether they deny them or succumb to their temptation. The **Valcrest curse** is not only a burden, but also a mark of their family’s legacy—an eternal struggle against their own desires for power, revenge, and the edge that these cursed weapons provide.
