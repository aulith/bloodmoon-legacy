The **Order of the Silver Stake** is the **unified front** of vampire hunters, founded long ago as a response to the growing threat of vampires and their influence over the land. United under a single banner, the Order brings together various hunter families, each with their own unique methods and traditions. While the families within the Order may hold differing beliefs and practices, they are united by one singular purpose: the eradication of vampires and the protection of the living.

At the helm of the Order is [[The Bloodmoon Legacy/The Vampire Hunter Families/Delacroix\|Delacroix]], a long-standing lineage of **tacticians** and **strategists**, known for their political acumen, leadership, and firm commitment to the cause. The Delacroix family has led the Order since its founding, maintaining a delicate balance of power between the various factions within the hunter community. They are the **commanders**, the **coordinators**, and the **influencers** who ensure that the efforts of all the disparate factions are aligned toward a common goal. Under their leadership, the Order has grown from a collection of local families into a powerful **organization** with resources, influence, and connections spread across multiple regions.

### **Origins of the Order**

The **Order of the Silver Stake** was founded in a time of great darkness when vampire houses—those who had once lurked in the shadows—began to rise in power. As their influence spread, entire regions fell under the sway of the undead. The various vampire hunter families had always acted independently, but as the threat grew, they realized that unity was their only hope. [[The Bloodmoon Legacy/The Vampire Hunter Families/Delacroix\|Delacroix]], known for their ability to broker alliances and forge strong bonds, spearheaded the creation of a single, unified force—the Order.

While each family retains its individual identity and autonomy, the Delacroix family acts as the unifying force, overseeing major decisions, coordinating hunts, and ensuring that there is no infighting among the factions.
